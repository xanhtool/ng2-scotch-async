<h1>Posts by: {{ blogger }}</h1>
<div *ngIf="posts">
   <app-posts [data]="posts"></app-posts>
</div>

<p>A few things to note:

Since the grouping logic runs in ngOnInit, that means it will run only once. If there's any future updates on data (passed in from blogger component), it won't trigger again.
Therefore, if someone change the posts: Post[] property in the blogger component to posts: Post[] = [], that means our grouping logic will be triggered once with empty array. When the real data kicks in, it won't be triggered again.</p>
